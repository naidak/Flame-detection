# Flame-detection
This project is designed to monitor for flame or fire presence using an IoT-based system, which triggers alerts or safety measures in response. The system uses a flame sensor connected to a microcontroller, sending real-time data to a web or mobile application where users can monitor the status and receive notifications in case of fire.

#Features
Real-Time Flame Detection: Detects flames using a flame sensor and triggers alerts.
Microcontroller-Based Processing: Uses a microcontroller (ESP8266) to monitor the sensor.
Cloud Integration: Stores detection events and notifications on a cloud platform (Firebase).
Remote Monitoring: Users can view flame detection events remotely via a web app.
Alarm Activation: Triggers an alarm (with buzzer) when flames are detected.

# Hardware Requirements
Flame Sensor Module
Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, NodeMCU)
Relay Module (for triggering alarms/safety measures)
Buzzer (for local alert)
LED (for visual status indication)
WiFi Module (for IoT connectivity, if not integrated)
Power Supply
